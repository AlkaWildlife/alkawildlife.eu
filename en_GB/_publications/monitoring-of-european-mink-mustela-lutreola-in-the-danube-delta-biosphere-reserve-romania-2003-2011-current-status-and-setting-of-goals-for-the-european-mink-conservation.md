The European mink (Mustela lutreola L.) is critically endangered. The Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve (DDBR) is one of the last refuges of this species. Within the DDBR the European mink is still widespread as indicated by 74 life captures in a number of expeditions between 2003 and 2011. No American mink (Neovison vison), a serious threat to the European mink, were trapped or observed during 2000 and 2011 in the DDBR. Trapping success varied both between years and between trapping areas, but up to know the underlying factors for these patterns are not understood. It may be a combination of generally changing mink densities in the Delta due to food availability or reproduction success and habitat quality as a local factor. In this context we discuss potential limiting factors and outline some aspects for a future management plan of the species.
