A life trapping survey conducted in late winter and early spring 2003 revealed that European mink Mustela lutreola are still numerous in the central and eastern part of the Romanian part of the Danube delta. They are also present in the south of the delta in the lagoon complex. No American mink were caught during that trapping period. However, there is evidence for an established M. vison population on the Ukraine side of the delta and at present this may be considered as the most serious threat for M. lutreola in the Danube delta.
