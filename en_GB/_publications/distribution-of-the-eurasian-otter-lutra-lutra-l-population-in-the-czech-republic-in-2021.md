A study of Eurasian otter distribution in the Czech Republic was carried out in autumn 2021. The survey 

was based on monitoring of otter signs at four to six sites (mainly bridges) per quadrant of 11,2 x 12 km 

(S-JTSK grid). The entire territory of the country was surveyed. During the survey 2501 sites were 

controlled, 2033 of them being positive. In total, 96 % of quadrants are regularly occupied by otters and 

additional 3 % of quadrants show “irregular” occurrence. The rest of the territory (1 % of quadrants) is 

without otter presence. More detaiedl analysis shows that in some areas the otter population has slightly 

increased and in others has slightly decreased. The causes may be different in different areas.
