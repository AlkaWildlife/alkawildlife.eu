The Eurasian otter (_Lutra lutra_) is one of the most endangered, specially protected animals in the Czech Republic which is protected by European legislation. At the same time, however, it is also a so-called _conflict species_ as it can cause considerable damage, especially in pond management. For this reason, in 2009 a 10 year 'Programme of Care for the Eurasian Otter in the Czech Republic' was launched, seeking to comprehensively address the protection of otters, including the conflict with fishermen. Detailed monitoring of the species, including the collection and analysis of dead individuals, is an integral part of the programme, both in terms of population status monitoring and in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of the measures implemented.
