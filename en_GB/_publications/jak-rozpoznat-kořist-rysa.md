The Eurasian lynx lives covertly, generally active at night so often its presence in a given territory is recognised only by the presence of captured prey. Not all carrion found in the forest has been predated by a lynx however, as some animals may have been caught by a dog, it may have been shot or simply have died from natural causes. It is not, therefore, easy to objectively judge whether a dead animal is truly a lynx prey. The 'Guide to Identifying Lynx Prey' is for anyone who is interested to find out if it was a which lynx caught any carrion found, but also for those who want to help monitor the Eurasian lynx in our country.
