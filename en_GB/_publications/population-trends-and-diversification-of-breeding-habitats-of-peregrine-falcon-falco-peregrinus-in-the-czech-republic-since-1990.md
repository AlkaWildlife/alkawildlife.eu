The population of the Peregrine Falcon in the Czech Republic recovered from a nearly total extinction during the 1960s and 1980s (0-3 breeding pairs) and the first successful breeding after this interval was confirmed in 1995. The increase of the population size accelerated after 2000 and it is still growing. There were 89 known pairs in 2016. More and more pairs are nowadays breeding on industrial buildings.
