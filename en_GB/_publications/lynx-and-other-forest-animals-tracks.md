After years of persecution, the Eurasian lynx is returning to the quieter areas of the Czech and Moravian mountains. You can find their tracks on snow or other soft ground. With positive identification of tracks alongside other determining factors such as faeces and urine, scratches on trees or kill sites, we are able to prove the presence of lynx in these areas. This publication serves to identify Eurasian lynx tracks and to distinguish the main species that can be encountered in our forest.
