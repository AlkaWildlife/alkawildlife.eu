The Eurasian otter can be found across the Czech Republic. But there are some important factors that can threaten the population. One is an increased amount of traffic on the road, which can cause mortality to individuals, especially adults. 

Long-term research has shown that this unfavourable risk factor to the otters survival can be greatly reduced through risk spot identification and technical solutions to how we can ensure safe passage under the roads. The measures which allow passage for otters is also suitable for the whole a number of other small to medium-sized animals who live in the landscape along streams.
