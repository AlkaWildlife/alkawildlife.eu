In the year 2021 two snow tracking surveys were carried out, in Orlické hory PLA and Dačice region. 

In Dačice region, a fishpond area, 12 adults were identified in 100 km2 size area, in three cases the 

female was followed by unknown number of cubs (conditions were not sufficient to assess the number 

of siblings). In Orlické hory PLA, mountain region of 204 km2, eight adults were identified, one female 

was followed by two cubs. Comparison with results from previous censuses shows that winter densities 

are stable in time in both areas.
