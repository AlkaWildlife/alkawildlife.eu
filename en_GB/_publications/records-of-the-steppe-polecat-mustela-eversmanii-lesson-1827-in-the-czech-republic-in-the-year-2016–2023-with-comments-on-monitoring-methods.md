The recent distribution of the steppe polecat in the Czech Republic was

surveyed in 2016–2023 using searching for road causalities, cameratraps and citizen

science. A total of nine independent records were obtained from seven standard

mapping squares. The steppe polecat recently occurs in southern Moravia. A single

occurrence records were obtained from Pardubický and Olomoucký region.
