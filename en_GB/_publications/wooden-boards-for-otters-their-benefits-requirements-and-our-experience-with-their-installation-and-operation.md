Otters live in streams and other aquatic habitats. When they reach a road and the stream is led through 

bridge/culvert not adapted for animals, they often prefer to cross the road at the surface. This leads to 

high traffic mortality. Wooden boards are one of possible measures to modify bridges/culverts to be 

used by otters to safely cross roads/railways. Basic requirements and our experience with installation 

and operation are described. Wooden boards described in the article are very well working, used by 

otters, but also by other small mammals.
