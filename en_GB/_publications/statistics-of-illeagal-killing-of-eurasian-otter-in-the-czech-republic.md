Conflict between protected otter and fishermen is manifested by illegal killing of the specimen in the Czech Republic. All discovered and proved cases of intentional killing are listed. The most common way of killing is poisoning by carbofuran, followed by shooting and catching to leg-hold traps. Due to illegal character of the phenomenon, we expect that 38 killed individuals represent just the tip of the iceberg.
