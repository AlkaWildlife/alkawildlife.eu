The distribution survey of Eurasian Otter (Lutra lutra L.) in the Republic of Macedonia was carried out in spring 2007 by searching for otter signs. During the survey 36 sites, spaced out over the whole territory of the country, were controlled. Totally 70% of points surveyed were positive and the majority of the country appears occupied by otter. Two bigger areas show low or no otter occurrence: the upper part of the Crna River catchment seems to be unoccupied by otter and the catchment of the Strumica River shows low site occupancy. The gaps in the occurrence of otter are probably connected with pollution – industrial (the Kriva Lakavica River) and agricultural (the Crna River, the Strumica River). Nothing can be said about population trends, because there are no historical data available.
