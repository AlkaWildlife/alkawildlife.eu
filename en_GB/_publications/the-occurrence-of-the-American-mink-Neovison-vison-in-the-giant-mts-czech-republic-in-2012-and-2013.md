Selected water streams located in the Krkonoše Mts National Park and its buffer zone (Krkonoše/Giant Mts) were surveyed for the presence of the alien American mink in 2012 and 2013 using floating rafts and live box traps. The occurrence of the species was recorded on several streams in the western and eastern parts of the mountains, but rivers in the central part were not occupied by the mink.
