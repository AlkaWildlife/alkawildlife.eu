From 2008-2012 twelve, we completed twelve snow tracking surveys across nine 10x10km2 squares in the Czech Republic. 

Number of individuals identified in different squares varied between 1-29 adult otters per 100km2. 

Higher densities were found in fishpond areas compared to mountain areas. Dependent cubs made up 36% of the population and the average size of litter was 1.58.
