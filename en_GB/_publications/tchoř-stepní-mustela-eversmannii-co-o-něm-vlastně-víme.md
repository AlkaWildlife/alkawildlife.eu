The steppe polecat (Mustela eversmannii) is considered to be a seriously endangered species in Europe, protected under the Habitats Directive. However, its current distribution range, populations’ status in individual member states, biology and ecology are poorly known. The goal of this paper is to review the current knowledge of the species’ taxonomy, distribution, biology and ecology and thus raise interest in the species mapping and conservation.
