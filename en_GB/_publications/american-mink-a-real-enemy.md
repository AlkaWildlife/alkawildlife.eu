The project ‘Measures to mitigate the impact of invasive animals in Western Slovakia and South Moravia’ is focussed on reassessing the status of the American mink and reducing this by actively catching them, to protect our native animal species.

In Živa magazine (2018/5), we published a summary article on the American mink. It contains basic information about this species, its population status and its impact on European fauna.
