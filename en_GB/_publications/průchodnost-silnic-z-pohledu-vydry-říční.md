The study of patency of roads in the Czech Republic from the perspective of the Eurasian otter. 

Through this study, concrete measures have been proposed. This was following the inspection and analysis of selected sections of Class I road sites where Eurasian otter have died and also took into account factors that influence road throughput. An online accessible map application has also been created which publishes these results.
