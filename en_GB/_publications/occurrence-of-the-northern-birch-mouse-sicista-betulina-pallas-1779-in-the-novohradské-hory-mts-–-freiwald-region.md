Novohradské hory Mts. – Freiwald region is one of the few refuges of the northern

birch mouse in Central Europe. Altogether 33 records of the northern birch mouse have been collected

from the area during the last twenty years (2003–2022). These, together with 17 previous

records from the years 1969 to 2002, make 50 records of the northern birch mouse from the region.

Records are unevenly distributed within the area, which is probably the result of different local

survey effort and does not show the full picture of the distribution of the species. The species occurs

in a wide range of altitudes from 610 m a.s.l. up to 955 m a.s.l. and has been found in various

types of habitats including abandoned wetlands, wet meadows, mowed meadows, forest edges,

and gardens.
