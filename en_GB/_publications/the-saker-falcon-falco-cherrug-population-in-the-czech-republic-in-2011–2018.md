The first records of the Saker Falcon breeding on the territory of the Czech Republic come from the 19th century. We suppose its breeding has a longer history, but we miss more precise data, which is complicated by probable confusions with Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus). Only very few breeding records were documented up to 1950, all of them were situated in the western part of the country – Bohemia (Hudec & Štˇastný 2005). In the second half of the 20th century, the breeding population in the Pannonian part of Moravia (SE part of the country) was established and up to now, almost the whole recent Czech Saker Falcon population has been concentrated here in the South Moravian region.
