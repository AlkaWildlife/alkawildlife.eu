During the period between 2nd and 10th of March 2011 the wildcat survey was carried out in two areas of the Danube Delta Biosphere Reserve. The first surveyed area was located in surroundings of the field station Dovnica, including the canal Dunarea Veche and Dovnica. Second area was situated nearby the field station of Julia, including canals Sontea, Fortuna and Lake Rotund. Camera-traps (Scout Guard) were used for the surveying. All camera-traps were set for the whole day and night, highest sensitivity and when triggered they recorded 30 seconds long videos. In order to raise attractiveness of the place with camera-traps the bait was placed in front of each camera-trap. Totally 19 camera-traps were used in both areas and 130 camera-traps nights were recorded. From 67 videos taken, four recorded the individual of wildcat. Three places were located in the surrounding of Dovnica, one place was situated nearby the Julia Rosu. Apart of videos recorded, the tracks of wildcat were found in the area of Julia.
