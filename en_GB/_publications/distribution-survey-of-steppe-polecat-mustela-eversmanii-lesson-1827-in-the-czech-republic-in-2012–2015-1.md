The recent distribution of the steppe polecat in the Czech Republic was surveyed in 2012–2015 using questionnaires, searching for road causalities, cameratraps and live-traps. A total of nine different records were obtained from eight standard mapping squares. The steppe polecat recently occurs in southern Moravia with a partial overlap into central Moravia. A single occurrence record was obtained from central Bohemia (Polabí). The distribution of the species in the country is probably scattered with low population density.
