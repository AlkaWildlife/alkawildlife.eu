This handbook was created for the following reasons:

* to draw attention to the problem of otters dying on roads, 
* provide examples of situations in which this problem occurs, 
* to make recommendations for best practice and 
* to provide examples of suitable and inappropriate solutions using practical demonstrations. 

The handbook also includes a description of the administrative procedures recommended to ensure that requirements for the protection of the Eurasian otter are met during planning future transport structures.
