The Eurasian otter is a native species of the Czech Republic. According to available historical data, the otter was widespread throughout the country until the middle of the 19th century. Changes in the area and population size occurred gradually during the second half of the 19th and during the 20th century. The main causes of this population decline were overhunting, changes and degradation of the environment and the pollution of streams from industry and agriculture. In the 1970s and 1990s, otters were only found in three separate areas on 30% of Czech Republic´s territory. Between 1990 and 2016 three populations that had been separated for several decades gradually reconnected, and the otters returned to all the watersheds in the country. According to the last two nationwide mappings in 2016 and 2021, the population is widespread across the entire country. However, a more detailed look shows certain dynamics – which differ depending on the area. The population is still vulnerable due to the existence of significant risk factors that endanger it at present; the main ones being: illegal hunting, roadkill deaths, a poor state of their aquatic environment and pollution.
