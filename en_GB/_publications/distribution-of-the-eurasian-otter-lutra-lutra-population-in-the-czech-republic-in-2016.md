A study of Eurasian otter distribution in the Czech Republic was carried out in autumn 2016. The survey was based on monitoring of otter signs at four to six sites (mainly bridges) per quadrant of 11,2 x 12 km (S-JTSK grid). The entire territory of the republic was surveyed. During the survey 2492 sites were controlled, 2081 of them being positive. In total, 95 % of quadrants are regularly occupied by otter and additional 3 % of quadrants show “irregular” occurrence. The rest of the territory (2 % of quadrants) is without otter presence. Otter population has increased in some areas since the last survey in 2011. However, in others a decrease was observed, together with the influence of risk of drought on otter occurrence.
