Ukraine is a beautiful and huge country. From the Carpathian Mountains, with an altitude of up to 2,000 m.a.s.l, across the hills and vast steppes along the rivers Dniester, Dnieper, and many others, extends to the sea coast of the Black and Azov Seas. Let's look at its nature and landscape through the eyes of naturalists who visited Ukraine before the Russian invasion. Join us and share your photos and experiences with us who have been to Ukraine. Thanks to the authors for sharing photos. We thank the Ukrainian people for their democratic and civil society efforts. Glory to Ukraine!
Ukrajina je krásná a obrovská země. Z karpatských hor s nadmořskou výškou až 2 000 m.n.m. přes pahorkatiny a rozsáhlé stepi se podél řek Dnister, Dněpr a mnoha dalších rozkládá až k mořskému pobřeží Černého a Azovského moře. Pojďme se podívat na její přírodu a krajinu očima přírodovědců, kteří zde byli ještě před ruskou invazí. Kdo jste na Ukrajině byli, přidejte se a podělte se s námi o své fotografie a zážitky. Děkujeme autorům za sdílení fotek. Děkujeme ukrajinskému lidu za jejich úsilí o demokratickou a občanskou společnost. Sláva Ukrajině!

"_I am sending a few pictures from the island, which was created by the flooding of sand and bivalve molluscs during a big storm in the 90s and is bisected by the Ukraine / Romania border. Ukrainians consider it the youngest mainland in Europe and call it the Island of Nova zemlja. Because predators have not yet reached it, it is now a nesting ground for colony bird species. During a visit in 2011, we discovered the first nesting of a great black-headed gull in Romania. This species has an area from Central Asia to the south of Russia and Ukraine, where it nests on the sandy islands around the Azov and Caspian Seas, in the Crimea and on the banks of the great rivers Volga and Dnieper. We found a colony of several hundred pairs that already had cubs, kept away from bald gulls, and guarded the cubs in kindergartens. Unlike Caspian gulls, which are aggressive and attack each other, great black-headed gulls are calm and non-aggressive, they just guard their youngs against Caspian gulls. In addition to seagull colonies, there were numerous colonies of northern terns, common terns and pied avocet on the island. I was there again with Austrian filmmakers in 2014 and colonies of all species were smaller. Unfortunately, I do not know what the situation looks like at the moment._"    Aleš Toman

" _In May 2017, we went to western Ukraine to map birds to European Atlas. In some countries or territories, occurence data are missing, and so volunteers came from elsewhere to fill these gaps. In short, an ideal holiday. Along the way, we had fun reading reprints of first republic guides. Motoring advices, or advices, what to take with to the mountains, they seemed funny in today's context, but they also referred on a common history and because we defended the modern information, this preparation created a mysterious atmosphere - into what the world we are actually going? We arrived at night, woke up in the morning in a mapping square, then we split up and started mapping and counting. What at first glance, or rather listening, I was fascinated, was (in comparison with us) great richness of village birds. Complex analyzes is not necessary, the traditional way of farming, the number of domestic animals and the diversity of gardens, heaths and the surroundings of the villages was obvious. Except the beautiful landscapes and the number of birds we observed pleased us cordiality, smiles and cheerfulness of the locals. The grief of the war was already evident five years ago. Wounds were returning from the front in the east, traumatized people and in some villages we saw new monuments to the fallen. Lowland rivers are often unregulated and wetlands are part of it countries. I would dwell more on the woods. At first glance, the mountains catch your eye, which I knew from before, but the vastness of the forests and the preserved forests always amaze you. Complete tree felling was not visible at all from the top of Stý mountain. There is species richness in the countryside formed not by subsidy titles, but by intensive human activities and their animals. The photo shows an ancient grazing forest near the village Oleshnyk. What we have fixed into ecological groups in totally uprooted landscape, this obviously does not apply there. In such a forest, which, in fact, from a forestry point of view, is not a forest, is the abundance of forest species and also open and agricultural landscape species. In the vicinity of village Korytyšče a shepherd at his pasture read the book in the fog. The heathland around the village passes through birches overgrown edges in the forest. It's actually a tree stump, the inhabitants cut as soon as he reaches the appropriate size into the stove and he will paint again from stump that can be hundreds of years old. The Mohicans grow from the stand: they are either grown on beams or reach dimensions when they would be it is too difficult to knock them down, process them and tow them to the house. Life here is hard, the cheerfulness and cordiality of the people in the countryside, which we have had the opportunity to meet, is admirable. Hopefully not even the war will not break._"    Gašpar Čamlík
