Ukraine is a beautiful and huge country. From the Carpathian Mountains, with an altitude of up to 2,000 m.a.s.l, across the hills and vast steppes along the rivers Dniester, Dnieper, and many others, extends to the sea coast of the Black and Azov Seas. Let's look at its nature and landscape through the eyes of naturalists who visited Ukraine before the Russian invasion. Join us and share your photos and experiences with us who have been to Ukraine. Thanks to the authors for sharing photos. We thank the Ukrainian people for their democratic and civil society efforts. Glory to Ukraine!
