If you have a nice amount of snow in your local area, why not try and find out which animals you share your surroundings with. 

To determine who a track belongs to there are many things to consider. Main things to consider are what it generally looks like, how far apart they are and where they have been or look like they are going. 

When looking at the track, check for the number of fingers, the placement and also if claws can be seen or not.  Even if you have an identification guide, it's always good to take into consieration what the snow is like your track is in. Tracks can look very different on a thin, solid surface in comparison to deep, collapsing snow.

Check out our pictures to see some examples of different species and some helpful tips on how to identify them.
