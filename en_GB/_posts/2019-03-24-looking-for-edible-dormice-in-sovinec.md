# About Dormice on the radio

If you can't make it to Dlouhá Loučky, then listen out to our programme on Czech Radio Two, Meteor this weekend. The Meteor programme is going to be broadcast on Saturday at 8:05 am and on Sunday at 02:00, and ultimately it will end up in the radios archive. 

Supported by a grant from Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The project is implemented with the financial support of the EEA funds 2009-2014 and the Ministry of the Environment. The content of this seminar is exclusively the responsibility of ALKA Wildlife, o.p.s. and cannot in any way be regarded as the opinion of the donor or the Ministry of the Environment.
