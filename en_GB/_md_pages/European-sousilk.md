The European ground squirrel (_Spermophilus citellus_), otherwise known at the European souslik or simply souslik, is an endangered rodent species and is one of Europe's rarest mammals. 

# Habitat

Sousliks can be found in short grassy areas such as meadows, pastures, vineyards, orchards, golf courses and grassy airports. They dig extensive burrows which they use to hide from predators during the day, sleep in at night and also for hibernating in during autumn and winter. Their diet mainly consists of plants and grasses found in the environment around them.

# Conservation status

Until the 1960s, sousliks were a common part of agricultural land not only in the Czech Republic, but across Central and South-Eastern Europe. Since then, its abundance has declined significantly and it’s now very rare. 

In the Czech Republic they are now categorised as **critically endangered** and it is forbidden to catch or kill them.
