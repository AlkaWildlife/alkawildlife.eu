OUR SYMBOL

Our symbol is the Great Auk, a black and white birds similar to penguins. The Great Auk, like many species, became extinct in 1844, due to human activity. Now, 160 years on, there is and increasing trent of species extinction, on a local, regional and global level. This is still due to influence of man. We can be part of the change though, by protecting our species and biodiversity.
