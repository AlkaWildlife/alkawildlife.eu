## **OUR SYMBOL**

Our symbol is the Great Auk, a black and white birds similar to penguins. In 1844 it was hunted to extinction. Now, 160 years on, extinction due to human intervention has not stopped. On the contrary, there is an increasing trend of species extinction, across local, regional and global levels. We,however, believe we can help change this trend by protecting our species and biodiversity.

## **COMPANY MISSION**

To acquire, disseminate and apply information related to animal biology and ecology in order to protect species by providing effective, scientifically-based protection and management.
