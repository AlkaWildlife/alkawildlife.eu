We engage in research, monitoring and protection of selected mammal and bird species. One method we use is to collect carcasses and or occurrence/observation data from across the Czech Republic. Please help us and let us know about your findings, current or from the past. Anyone can contribute by recording their observations. You can send us information by email and would be happy to see any photos you might have. If you find a dead animal, you can call us to organise the collection.
