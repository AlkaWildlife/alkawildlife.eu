If you are interested in our activities, we welcome and appreciate your support. Usually, funding is conditional on the applicant's participation. For some projects, it is necessary for us to secure additional money. Donations are a greatly appreciated source of funding for us to be able to continue our work.

Your support may be in the form of:

* **Equipment** such as office material or fieldwork supplies 
* **General donation** which would provide financial support for the company or specific projects
* **Project donation** where you would provide financial support for a project of your choosing

If you intend to support us, please contact the [_company director_](/about-us/contacts).

For all forms of support, we will conclude an appropriate contract with you, or we will issue a receipt of the gift.

Individuals can deduct the value of gifts from their tax payments if their total value in the tax period exceeds 2%, or it is at least 1000 CZK. In total, a maximum 10% can be deducted.

Companies may deduct the value of financial gifts from their tax payments if the total value in the tax period is at least CZK 2,000. In total, a maximum of 5% can be deducted.
