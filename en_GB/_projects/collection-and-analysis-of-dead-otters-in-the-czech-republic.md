title: Collection and analysis of dead otters in the Czech Republic
published: true
funding: >-
  Collection of dead otters in the Czech Republic has occurred since 1990. From
  2008, it has been organised by our company through various financial sources: 


  2008 - 2010         Project: Finding missing data on biology and ecology of
  the Eurasian otter: creating a population development model


  2011, 2012           [Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech
  Republic](http://www.ochranaprirody.cz/) and own funds


  2013, 2014           Own funds


  2015 - 04/2017    Project: Implementation of selected measures from the care
  programme for the Eurasian otter in the Czech Republic


  05/2017, 2018      [Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech
  Republic](http://www.ochranaprirody.cz/) and own funds
from: 2008-01
to: 2019-12

  This project is focussed on the collection of dead river otters from across
  the Czech Republic. We then examine these animals to inform us on population
  demographics such as age structure, sex ratio and mortality rate.

# Project overview

Monitoring the status of endangered animal populations is usually based on assessing their distribution. However, systematic data on the deaths of individuals can also be a significant source of information. Finding the causes of wildlife mortality provides a valuable source of information about the factors affecting their populations. In addition to the causes of death, many important parameters of a given population can also be monitored by performing further analyses such as detailed autopsies, DNA analyses, X-rays, tooth cut, etc. These data can then be used to determine population age structure, sex ratio, mortality rate and genetic variability or gene flow. These data, especially if they are collected over a long period of time and by a consistent method, are an invaluable tool for monitoring the development of these populations. 

Since the 1990s, dead otter collection for these reasons has occurred across the Czech Republic. From 2008, however, ALKA Wildlife o.p.s. has taken on this responsibility. This is our long-term goal and we aim to deal with this topic in more detail in the future.
