title: Collection and analysis of dead otters in the Czech Republic
published: true
funding: >-
  The collection and analysis of otters in the Czech Republic has taken place
  since 1990. Since 2008 ALKA Wildlife has organised this project through
  various financial sources: 


  2008 - 2010: Through the project "_Finding missing data on biology and ecology
  of the Eurasian otter: creating a population development model"_


  2011 - 2012: [Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech
  Republic](http://www.ochranaprirody.cz/) and own funds


  2013 - 2014: Own funds


  2015 - 04/2017: Through the project "_Implementation of selected measures from
  the care programme for the Eurasian otter in the Czech Republic"_


  05/2017 - 2018: [Nature Conservation Agency of the Czech
  Republic](http://www.ochranaprirody.cz/) and own funds
from: 2008-01
to: 2019-12

  This project is focussed on the collection of dead Eurasian otters from across
  the Czech Republic. We conduct post mortem analysis and sample collection
  which informs us on population demographics such as age structure, sex ratio
  and mortality rate.

# Project overview

Monitoring the status of endangered animal populations is usually based on assessing their distribution. Systematic data on the deaths of individuals, however, can also be a significant source of information. Finding the causes of wildlife mortality provides a valuable source of information about the factors affecting their populations. In addition to the causes of death, many important parameters of a given population can also be monitored by performing further analyses such as detailed autopsies, DNA analyses, X-rays, etc. These data can then be used to determine population age structure, sex ratio, mortality rate and genetic variability or gene flow. If collected over a long period of time and by a consistent method, these data are an invaluable tool for monitoring the development of these populations.
