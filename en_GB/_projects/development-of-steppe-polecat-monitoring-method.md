The steppe polecat is a critically endangered species and is listed in Annex II. and IV. of Habitat Directive. Despite of that fact there are minimum information about the species, basic data about its occurrence, population status and life history are missing. It is one of the most data deficiency Eurasian mammal. The reason is its rarity and the absence of an effective monitoring tool. The main goal is to create systematic monitoring methodology based on a new, non-invasive methods. The sub-goals are: to define a procedure for a) confirmation of presence / absence, b) reproduction monitoring, c) population size estimation, e) evaluation of data quality for species identification.
