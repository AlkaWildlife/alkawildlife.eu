The main goal is to develop and test a new methodology for evaluating contamination in aquatic ecosystems through the analysis of tissues of an apex predator–Eurasian otter. Based on the premise that pollutant concentrations with bioaccumulative and biomagnification potential are higher at higher trophic levels, it can be assumed that the tissue from a territorial predator such as otter will be a representative sample of pollution in the local aquatic ecosystems. To achieve the goal, otter carcasses collected from the Czechia will be analyzed for selected representatives of both classic and new type of pollutants. The optimized procedures will be used to evaluate regional contamination of surface waters with per- and polyfluorinated substances, heavy metals and other risk elements.
