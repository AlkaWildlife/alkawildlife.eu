  The aim of the project was to map the occurrence of the American mink and
  regulate its population throughout the national park. The project also
  focussed on surrounding areas, especially in the river basin flowing into the
  park.

# Project aim

American mink (_Neovison vison_) belongs to the non-native species of mammal fauna in the Czech Republic. As an introduced species, it represents a danger to the original fauna of Europe's small and medium vertebrates. Nowadays, it can be found in a significant amount of the Czech Republic. In the Bohemian Switzerland National Park, its presence was first discovered in the winter of 2009, during a project to count otters in the snow. Thereafter, negotiations were held with the Administration of the Bohemian Switzerland National Park, which resulted in a contract of cooperation regarding the regulation of the American mink in the park and the development of this project. The aim of the project is to map the current occurrence and regulation of the mink population throughout the national park as well as in its surroundings, especially in the river basin flowing into the national park.

# Bohemian Switzerland National Park

Bohemian Switzerland National Park is located in the district of Decin in the area where the Elbe leaves the Czech Republic and flows into Germany. The main subject of protection are unique rock towns and competitions and specific flora and fauna bound to them. The area consists mostly of Cretaceous Mesozoic sediments. Later volcanic activity broke up to 1 km thick sandstone slab with a system of faults. For millions of years, the landscape has been modeled by a variety of erosive forces. The basic shapes of the area include a valley of gorges and canyons, surrounded by towers and massifs, forming rock towns. The Labe Canyon between Děčín and Hřensko represents a unique natural formation. Important tributaries include the Kamenice and Křinice streams. Watercourses often excel in quality and unregulated channels. The species-rich ichthyofauna is made up of both bream species (which live in the Elbe) and trout and grayling species. Salmon has returned after many years and is still the only locality in the Czech Republic. Of the other specially protected fish species, the European bullhead lives here. There are still numerous populations of crayfish, and rarely, there is also a critically endangered stone crayfish. Other species of endangered American mink include a number of amphibian species, such as green frogs, brown or ostrichos, great newts, mountain and municipal. The reptiles are mainly grass snake. Vulnerable species of birds include dipper, mountain wagtail or kingfisher.

# Methods

The project used proven methods, which we used and tested in the previous project Regulation of American Mink in Vysočina, and we also use photo traps for monitoring mink.

# Capture

The regulation of the local population of mink was carried out by the method of repeated capture of wild animals. The trapping was used for trapping. Catch traps are designed and installed to maximize mink capture and minimize trapping of other animal species.

# Monitoring

The occurrence of American mink was monitored by monitoring rafts and photo traps. Surveillance rafts are floating areas where a soft, permanently moist substrate is placed on which the animals leave a trail. Photo traps are photographic devices that are triggered by information from the thermal sensor.
