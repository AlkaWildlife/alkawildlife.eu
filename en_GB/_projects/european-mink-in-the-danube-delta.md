  In cooperation with the Danube Delta National Institute for Research and
  Development, basic monitoring of the European mink, one of Europe's most
  endangered mammals, took place in the Danube Delta.

The European mink (_Mustela lutreola_) is the second most endangered land animal of Europe, following the Iberian lynx (_Lynx pardinus_). The EU Habitats Directive has named the European mink among one of the priority species for which the EU has a particular responsibility. Currently, it is only present in a few isolated populations (France, Spain, Estonia, Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Romania), with a sharp decline in the number of all these populations, with the exception of Romania. 

Our activities in the Danube Delta focussed on the detection of the local population of European mink and the identification of risk factors threatening the population. This included identifying the potential occurrence of the non-native American mink (_Neovision vison_), which after being introduced to Europe in the 1920s, poses a significant risk to the original European mink population.
