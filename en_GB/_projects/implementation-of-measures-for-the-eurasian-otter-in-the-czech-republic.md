  Implementation of measures to support the Eurasian otter in the Czech
  Republic, focusing on two main areas: road mortality and conflict with
  fishermen
---
# Project objectives

The Eurasian otter is largest mammal living in our waters and has returned to the entirety of the Czech Republic after a significant drop in its numbers. There are still, however, many problems that threaten its existence. Implementation of selected measures of the "Care Programme for the Eurasian Otter in the Czech Republic" is vital to ensure long-term existence of this species in our landscape. 

This project focused on two important factors that influence the existence: 

1. Traffic collisions where many otters perish on the roads annually
2. Predator intolerance and conflict with some fishermen 

# Project activities

1. Mapping 'at risk' areas on the roads and creating proposals for solutions and presentation of these results to the relevant road managers.
2. Updating and reprinting the publication _"Otter and Transport: A Guide to Reducing the Negative Impact of Traffic on the Eurasian Otter"_
3. Creation of a website for the professional public, including an online map of areas 'at risk' to the Eurasian otter and online advice for fishermen.
4. Creation of a public website about the Otter trail on the Dyje.
5. Organisation of excursions and lectures in Dačice.
6. Conducting otter censuses in selected areas by snow tracking.
7. Collecting and analysing dead otters throughout the Czech Republic.
8. Completing the analysis of otter viability in our country.
9. Testing measures to reduce otter predation on ponds.
10. Writing a proposal for optimising the system of dealing with the conflict of economic interests of fisheries and otters.

# Main project outputs

## Website: [www.vydryonline.cz](https://www.vydryonline.cz)

Project official website - detailed description of project activities, project news. The aim of the website is to provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on the Eurasian otter in the Czech Republic. The site is intended mainly for the professional public and fishermen.

## Website: [www.vydristezky.cz](https://www.vydristezky.cz)

Otter trail website - information for public and schools about otters. The aim of the website is to provide basic information for visitors to the nature trail along the Dyje River.

## Online map: [www.vydrynasilnici.cz](http://www.vydrynasilnici.cz)

Otters on the road map - map of 'at risk' areas in the Czech Republic. The application is designed especially for PLO staff and road managers to obtain information on where incidents occur and how to improve road safety for otters and other animals wandering along the water.
