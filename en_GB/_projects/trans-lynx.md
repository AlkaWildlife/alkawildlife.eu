  The Šumava-Bavarian-Austrian population of the Eurasian lynx is our largest
  population of this rare animal, yet it is still endangered. The main goal of
  the Trans-Lynx project is to ensure better protection of these animals through
  cooperation of experts from Germany and the Czech Republic.

# Project activities

## Cross-border cooperation of individual interest groups

The aim of the project is to improve communication between state conservation, hunters, foresters, non-profit organisations or scientists. They can all contribute to protecting the Šumava-Bavarian population of this rare beast. However, they need to share research data, exchange experiences and work together to find solutions to problems associated with lynx occurring in the landscape.

## Biological data on population status

In order to effectively protect the lynx, it is necessary to obtain high-quality biological data on the state of the population and use this to assess the population status and analyse future trends. Camera traps were used to monitor lynx occurrence and signs of lynx presence were also mapped.

## Public awareness

Often, public attitudes towards the lynx decide its fate. As part of the project, a campaign aimed at raising awareness of the Eurasian lynx was created. It involved highlighting the need to protect the lynx populations whilst improving the relationship of selected interest groups of this species. The hope that his in turn would contribute to the reduction of illegal hunting, which is also a major threat to lynx.
