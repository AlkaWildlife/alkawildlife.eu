# Project aim

The aim of the project is to prepare a rescue programme for the Saker falcon (_Falco cherrug_), currently classed as a critically endangered species in the Czech Republic, and in 2012 the IUCN ranked it among the most endangered species worldwide. 

The Saker falcon is one of our rarest nesting birds. It has been nesting in the Czech Republic since at least the nineteenth century. Currently, however, it only regularly nests only in South Moravia. The South Moravian nesting population has been mapped and protected since 1976. From 1976-1980, 13 nesting sites were identified. Thanks to the protection of nesting sites and probably the growth of the population in neighbouring countries, the number of observations in the Czech Republic is gradually increasing. 

The national abundance of the Saker falcon is estimated to be 15-20 pairs in recent years. Due to extensive illegal hunting, however, the Asian population has fallen dramatically. It has been estimated that over the past 30 years its size has decreased by up to 90%. Thus, the small European population (about 600-800 pairs) has gained in importance and is currently receiving considerable conservation attention.
