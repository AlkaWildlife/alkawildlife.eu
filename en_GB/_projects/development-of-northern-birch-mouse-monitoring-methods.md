The Northern birch mouse is a highly endangered species in the Czech Republic. Its occurrence is

limited to a few isolated mountain populations and is still one of the most difficult small mammal

species to monitor. The goal of the project is to develop a methodology for the detection and

monitoring of one of the least explored and rare mammals. Using modern technology, we plan to

define procedures to obtain standardized, objective and comparable data on the occurrence of the

species in the target location. Another goal is to obtain updated data on the occurrence of the

species and provide them in the form of open access to the state administration and the

professional public.
