# Project aim

The aim of this project was to develop the educational 'Otter Trail' on the Thaya River. The route has not been modified and it follows the tourist trail. The project created 9 information panels and they were installed along the trail.

# Public engagement

In 2012 and 2013, an accompanying series of lectures took place in the town library in Dačice. Further details, maps, news and otter talks can all be found on [this website](www.vydristezky.cz), specifically created for this project.
