 The American mink (Neovison vison) was introduced to Italy for the fur farming industry during the 1950s. The first feral mink were observed in the 1980s in the northern regions of Veneto, Friuli Venezia Giulia and Emilia Romagna. In this work, we investigated the distribution of mink in Friuli Venezia Giulia, more than 10 years after the last extensive release of farmed animals which happened in this region in 2003. Results indicate that American mink has naturalized in the region and populations are still localized along some tributaries of the upper Tagliamento catchment.
