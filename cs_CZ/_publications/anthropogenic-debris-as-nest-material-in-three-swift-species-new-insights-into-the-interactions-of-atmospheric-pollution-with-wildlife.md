We assess the addition of anthropogenic materials in nests of three swift species. We found plastic in the 36.5 % of the nests evaluated, with differences among species. The probability of finding plastic in the nests increases at higher human footprint. Our results suggest a direct interaction between atmospheric plastic and wildlife. This is the first study to demonstrate contamination by anthropogenic materials in swifts' nests.
