Rehabilitation of injured or immature individuals has become an increasingly used conservation 

and management tool. However, scientific evaluation of rehabilitations is rare, raisingconcern about post-release welfare as well as the cost-effectiveness of spending scarce

financial resources. Over the past 20 years, events of juvenile Eurasian lynx presumably

orphaned have been observed in many European lynx populations. To guide the management

of orphaned lynx, we documented survival, rehabilitation and fate after the release and

evaluated the potential relevance of lynx orphan rehabilitation for population management

and conservation implications. Data on 320 orphaned lynx was collected from 1975 to 2022

from 13 countries and nine populations. The majority of orphaned lynx (55%) were taken to

rehabilitation centres or other enclosures. A total of 66 orphans were released back to

nature. The portion of rehabilitated lynx who survived at least one year after release was

0.66. Release location was the best predictor for their survival. Of the 66 released lynx, ten

have reproduced at least once (8 females and 2 males). Conservation implications of rehabilitation

programmes include managing genetic diversity in small, isolated populations and

reintroducing species to historical habitats. The lynx is a perfect model species as most reintroduced

populations in Central Europe show significantly lower observed heterozygosity

than most of the autochthonous populations, indicating that reintroduction bottlenecks, isolation

and post-release management have long-term consequences on the genetic composition

of populations. The release of translocated orphans could be a valuable contribution

to Eurasian lynx conservation in Europe. It is recommended to release orphans at the distribution

edge or in the frame of reintroduction projects instead of a release in the core area of

a population where it is not necessary from a demographic and genetic point of view. Rehabilitation

programmes can have conservation implications that extend far beyond individual

welfare benefits.
