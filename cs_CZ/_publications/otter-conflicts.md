 In the Czech Republic ﬁsh farming is common throughout the country with a strong hold of carp production in southern Bohemia.The conﬂict arising from otter predation on commercial ﬁsh rapidly increased due to the political and social changes since 1989. Nature protection authorities undertook a set of measurements to appease the conﬂict. It included compensation schemes for losses,publicrelations etc., however, the conﬂict has continued. Within the FRAP project, social and ecological research was carried out and provided further recommendations how to mitigate the conﬂict. These are a continuous assessment of the compensation scheme, a simpliﬁcation, differentiation and decentralization of the compensation payments, joint data collection, and setting up an organization of small pond farmers, a better involvement of stakeholders in conﬂict mitigation and further ecological research to better understand the biological background of the conﬂict.
