Diet of the Eurasian otter was studied using the analysis of 2701 spraints collected along banks of 40 ponds in Českomoravská vrchovina (Bohemian-Moravian Highlands) in 2003–2004. Fish dominated the diet (80%, expressed as the relative number of individuals), with 19 different species identiﬁ ed. The proportion of ﬁ sh in the diet varied signiﬁ cantly at different ponds, ranging from 25% to 100%. Amphibians (frogs, toads and occasionally newts) made up the second most important prey group with 13%. Crayﬁ sh were only locally important, reaching 4% of prey consumed. Other prey groups such as insects, birds, mammals and reptiles occurred rather sporadically. The common carp was the most important ﬁ sh species in the diet (24%), reﬂ ecting the fact that the ponds are primarily used for its production. However, its proportion in the diet at ponds with stocked carp varied signiﬁ cantly from 2% to 91% of prey consumed. Other ﬁ sh species regularly found in the diet were perch (11%) and tench (9%). Roach, sunbleak, morroco, gudgeon, stone loach and grass carp were locally important. Other ﬁ sh species were taken rather occasionally. The diet varied among ponds concerning both the number of ﬁ sh species consumed and their proportion in the diet. Commercial ﬁ sh species made up 35% in the warm period and 42% in the cold period. When the diet composition was expressed in biomass values, the proportion of carp, and consequently of commercial ﬁ sh showed considerable differences compared to their relative abundance in the diet: 69% vs. 24% in the case of carp, and 70% vs. 35% in commercial ﬁ sh, respectively. Proportion of commercial ﬁ sh may be reduced signiﬁ cantly when alternative prey (non-commercial ﬁ sh species, frogs, crayﬁ sh) is available.
